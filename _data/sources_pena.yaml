  description: We investigate how neurons filter and code sensory inputs using temporal filters. Short-term plasticity (STP) and various processes influence these filters. We develop mathematical tools to understand their generation and extend the findings to complex networks.

  description: We investigate how rapidly fluctuating signals interact with neuronal properties, generating varied and coherent responses. Using linear and non-linear models, we explore the effects of piecewise constant inputs. We find that sustained oscillations and variability arise from the interaction between inputs and intrinsic cell dynamics, independent of input stochasticity.

  description: We analyze neuronal responses to oscillatory currents and synaptic-like inputs. Resonant cells exhibit selective resonance. Conductance-based inputs are attenuated compared to current-based inputs. Variability arises from different input orderings. Poisson-distributed synaptic inputs show attenuated responses. Our findings contribute to understanding oscillatory activity and network resonance.

  description: WARs, genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures, exhibit different GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) distributions compared to Wistar rats. Our computational model suggests two populations of GABAergic synapses in WARs, with reduced release frequency in a subset. This finding may contribute to their seizure susceptibility.

  description: We study activity propagation in modular spiking networks. Optimal information flow occurs with increased synaptic strength or number of modules. Population-level and pairwise information propagation show different patterns. Increasing synaptic strength and modules enhance information transmission.

  description: High-amplitude oscillatory currents induce asymmetric voltage responses in neurons due to nonlinearities in ionic currents and the voltage equation. Geometrical factors and time-scale separation contribute to these asymmetries. Surprising frequency-dependent patterns emerge in the gating variables of the currents. Our findings shed light on the ionic mechanisms involved in oscillatory information processing by neurons.
