I earned a bachelor's degree in physics from the Industrial University of Santander in Colombia, followed by a Master of Science in Physics from São Paulo University in Brazil. I then completed my academic journey with a Ph.D. in Physics from the same institution. Driven by a passion for physics, I established myself as a researcher in cellular and molecular neurophysiology. In 2024, I joined Pena’s lab as a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biological Sciences at Florida Atlantic University. My research focuses on understanding neuronal behavior through computer simulations using Matlab, encompassing the dynamic properties of ionic currents and synaptic physiology.
