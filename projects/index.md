We believe that science is fun! Come to watch a movie and learn neuroscience and artificial intelligence at
the Synaptic Popcorn Cinema at Jupiter FAU. 

We make the effort to provide movies where you will have the opportunity to learn beyond the classroom or the lab. 
After each film, we encourage you to share your thoughts and questions with fellow enthusiasts. 

<b>Admission is Free!</b>

Selected movies have Public Performance Licensing according to the <a href="https://libguides.fau.edu/copyright-for-teaching/streaming-video-copyright"> FAU library</a>.
