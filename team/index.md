I am dedicated to providing exceptional supervision and mentorship to students. I am committed to helping students and postdocs thrive academically and professionally. I prioritize open communication, constructive feedback, and personalized guidance to support each student's individual goals and aspirations. I believe in cultivating a collaborative atmosphere that encourages students to explore their scientific interests, develop critical thinking skills, and contribute meaningfully to their research projects. It is my utmost priority to ensure that students receive the necessary resources and support to excel in their academic pursuits. I am genuinely invested in their success and take pride in nurturing the next generation of computational neuroscientists.
