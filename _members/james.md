Hello! My name is James Lee, and I am currently a freshman at the Wilkes Honors College at Florida Atlantic University, majoring in Biological and Physical Sciences within the pre-medical BS/MD program. My academic journey is fueled by a profound interest in the life sciences and a commitment to advancing medical knowledge through rigorous research.

During my time at Dr. Pena’s Computational Neuroscience Lab, I am focusing on investigating the neurophysiological mechanisms of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the hippocampus using computational modeling techniques. This experience allows me to merge my passion for data analysis with my fascination for the brain's intricate processes. I am particularly interested in understanding how DBS-induced membrane depolarization affects neuronal responses and creates an informational lesion. By engaging in this research, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying DBS therapy for neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and essential tremor. The insights gained from this research have the potential to improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from these conditions by optimizing DBS protocols to enhance therapeutic outcomes and reduce adverse effects.

Through my rigorous coursework, I have gained knowledge in computer programs such as RStudio, Java, and Python. I joined Dr. Pena’s Computational Neuroscience Lab to apply my analytical skills to neuroscience research projects, with the goal of contributing to scientific advancements that benefit society.
