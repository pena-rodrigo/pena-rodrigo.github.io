My research background contains a wide array of different topics ranging from quantitative MS/LC-MS industry work at Thermo-Fisher Scientific, to qualitative research with The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory exploring behavioral characteristics behind the drive for environmental sustainability. I am a recent graduate of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida where I received my Bachelor of Science in Behavioral Neuroscience with specializations in Biology and Chemistry. I am currently taking post-bac courses at Florida Atlantic University to learn coding languages such as C and Python to set myself up for the increasingly computer-based future we have ahead. While studying, I am simultaneously working on a neural modeling project under Dr. Pena in his Computational Neuroscience lab at the university. Collaborating with like-minded professionals in both academia and industry has granted me the unwavering passion for learning and commitment to scientific advancement that I possess today which I look forward to maintaining for years to come.
