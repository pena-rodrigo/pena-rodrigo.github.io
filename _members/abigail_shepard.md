I am a freshman in the Wilkes Honors College at Florida Atlantic University, double majoring in Cellular Neuroscience and Interdisciplinary Mathematics as a premedical student in the BS/MD program.  I chose my areas of study to combine an interest in neuroscience with an enthusiasm for computational and analytical methods.  I completed AP Calculus AB in middle school, and continued my studies through multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations at the college level through dual enrollment while completing my high school diploma.  In my senior year of high school, I completed a mixed senior/graduate level course in neural networks through the Florida Institute of Technology, where I learned how to design and build neural network algorithms from scratch in addition to applying them through toolkits such as Tensorflow.  I am proficient in several programming languages including Java, Javascript, and Python.  I joined Dr. Penaâ€™s Computational Neuroscience Lab to contribute my skills to projects that address research questions in neuroscience using these analytical methods, with the hope that I can also contribute to the scientific advancement of society.
