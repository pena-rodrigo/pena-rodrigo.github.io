  description: We investigate how neurons filter and code sensory inputs using temporal
    filters. Short-term plasticity (STP) and various processes influence these filters.
    We develop mathematical tools to understand their generation and extend the findings
    to complex networks.

  description: We investigate how rapidly fluctuating signals interact with neuronal
    properties, generating varied and coherent responses. Using linear and non-linear
    models, we explore the effects of piecewise constant inputs. We find that sustained
    oscillations and variability arise from the interaction between inputs and intrinsic
    cell dynamics, independent of input stochasticity.

  description: We analyze neuronal responses to oscillatory currents and synaptic-like
    inputs. Resonant cells exhibit selective resonance. Conductance-based inputs are
    attenuated compared to current-based inputs. Variability arises from different
    input orderings. Poisson-distributed synaptic inputs show attenuated responses.
    Our findings contribute to understanding oscillatory activity and network resonance.

  description: We study activity propagation in modular spiking networks. Optimal
    information flow occurs with increased synaptic strength or number of modules.
    Population-level and pairwise information propagation show different patterns.
    Increasing synaptic strength and modules enhance information transmission.

  description: WARs, genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures, exhibit different
    GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) distributions compared to Wistar
    rats. Our computational model suggests two populations of GABAergic synapses in
    WARs, with reduced release frequency in a subset. This finding may contribute
    to their seizure susceptibility.

  description: High-amplitude oscillatory currents induce asymmetric voltage responses
    in neurons due to nonlinearities in ionic currents and the voltage equation. Geometrical
    factors and time-scale separation contribute to these asymmetries. Surprising
    frequency-dependent patterns emerge in the gating variables of the currents. Our
    findings shed light on the ionic mechanisms involved in oscillatory information
    processing by neurons.
