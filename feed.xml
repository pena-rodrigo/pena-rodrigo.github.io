In this edition, I am participating as one of the organizers.The ninth edition of the Latin American School on Computational Neuroscience – LASCON IX will be held at the NeuroMat Center in the main campus of the University of São Paulo in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The school will last for four weeks and will cover the following topics: single-cell models (biophysically detailed, reduced and simplified), circuit and network models of biophysically detailed and simplified spiking neurons, probabilistic neuronal models, synaptic plasticity and learning, spike train analysis, neural population models, neuron-glia interaction models, models of extracellular fields, brain criticality, computational psychiatry, traveling waves in neural systems, and dynamics of neuronal functional connectivity. These models will be illustrated with the use of the programs NEURON, NetPyNE, NEST, XPP-AUTO, Brian and The Virtual Brain. The faculty is composed of an international team of world-renowned researchers in the field of computational neuroscience.</p>
