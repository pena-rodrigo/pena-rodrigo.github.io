I am a senior majoring in Statistics at the Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil. Under the supervision of Professor Rodrigo Pena, my research focuses on applying machine learning models to identify the presence of glia cells in synaptic transmission. I am passionate about data and its technologies, exploring the endless possibilities in the field of data science.
