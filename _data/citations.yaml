  description: This study investigates brain firing patterns, specifically the shift from regular spiking to burst 
  firing in cortical neurons. It focuses on the role of potassium and calcium ion channels under various conditions. 
  Findings suggest that slow potassium currents are vital for high-synchronous activities and spike-to-burst transitions. 
  Bistable dynamics in neuronal networks underlie this transition, offering insights for potential pharmacological 
  interventions to move epileptic brains from pathological bursting to healthier states.

  description: We investigate how rapidly fluctuating signals interact with neuronal
    properties, generating varied and coherent responses. Using linear and non-linear
    models, we explore the effects of piecewise constant inputs. We find that sustained
    oscillations and variability arise from the interaction between inputs and intrinsic
    cell dynamics, independent of input stochasticity.

  description: We analyze neuronal responses to oscillatory currents and synaptic-like
    inputs. Resonant cells exhibit selective resonance. Conductance-based inputs are
    attenuated compared to current-based inputs. Variability arises from different
    input orderings. Poisson-distributed synaptic inputs show attenuated responses.
    Our findings contribute to understanding oscillatory activity and network resonance.

  description: High-amplitude oscillatory currents induce asymmetric voltage responses
    in neurons due to nonlinearities in ionic currents and the voltage equation. Geometrical
    factors and time-scale separation contribute to these asymmetries. Surprising

    findings shed light on the ionic mechanisms involved in oscillatory information

  description: Sino-aortic denervation (SAD) in rats alters breathing patterns without
    affecting sympathetic activity or arterial pressure. We observed prolonged inspiration,
    increased variability in late-inspiratory neurons, and reduced frequency in pre-inspiratory/inspiratory
    neurons. These findings suggest a timing imbalance in the respiratory network
    of SAD rats, impacting presympathetic neuron modulation after baroreceptor afferent
    removal.

    we identified different activity patterns. Noise transformed transient patterns
    into persistent ones. Networks with strong inhibition and moderate noise showed
    intermittent switches between oscillatory and quiescent states, resembling cortical
    states. Our findings reveal mechanisms underlying cortical activity at multiple

  description: The persistent sodium current (INaP) prolongs EPSP decay by increasing
    the membrane time constant. In the zero slope conductance region, non-decaying
    EPSPs are observed in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells. These EPSPs and delayed
    spikes are abolished by Na+ channel block and occur in response to small amplitude
    aEPSCs. This suggests that INaP enhances synaptic integration in distal dendritic
    regions.
