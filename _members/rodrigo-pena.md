I have always worked on communication between the different levels of organization of the brain with Computational Neuroscience. My research focuses on the computational modeling of ion channels, synapses, neurons, networks, and systems, which involve many spatial scales and their interactions. Throughout my career, I have also acquired expertise in Dynamical Systems, Stochastic Processes, Information Theory, and Deep Learning. Quantitative analysis that requires Data Science is also a part of my daily work. I received my Ph.D. in the field of Physics Applied to Medicine and Biology from the University of Sao Paulo. I also participated in a partnership with the International Research Training Group IRTG 1740 between Brazil and Germany. Correspondingly, I was a visiting scientist at the Humboldt University of Berlin and at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience. I have also received training and worked at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne as an undergraduate. These qualifications were essential for engaging in and contributing to several different projects of relevance established in the U.S. and around the world.
