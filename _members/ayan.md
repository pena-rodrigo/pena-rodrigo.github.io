I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Biological and Physical Sciences with a concentration in Data Analytics at Florida Atlantic University's Wilkes Honors College, while also dual enrolled as a high school student at FAU High School. My coursework has provided a solid foundation in database structures, algorithm analysis, deep learning, and AI applications in biology. As a Lab Research Assistant and Data Scientist at the FAU Wilkes Honors College, I lead an independent project investigating genetic influences on Alzheimer's disease in mice. Utilizing Python and Excel, I focus on age-related and brain-region-specific gene expression changes, analyzing RNA-seq data from 6- and 24-month-old mice to identify differentially expressed genes based on age, sex, and brain region. I joined Dr. Penaâ€™s Computational Neuroscience Lab to contribute my skills to projects that address research questions in neuroscience using these analytical methods, with the hope that I can also contribute to the scientific advancement of society.
